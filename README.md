## Usage Notes

### Firefox Users

Firefox will not allow you to share storage between pages.  This is a [feature and not a bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1730419).  Please load the demo from a local server to use with Firefox, e.g. `python3 -m http.server 8001`.  Be sure to use `localhost` rather than the IP address when doing this, for full compatibility with the IoT demo.  *These are only issues running locally, you will not experience issues running a hosted version of this app*


## Installing / Getting started

## Contributing
Please fork the repository if you'd like to contribute. Pull requests are always welcome.

## Logging in with the same user in two or more tabs

The application is designed primarily to be used by two different users in separate tabs (so one user can talk with the other).  If you want to have the same user running in multiple tabs, for example to demonstrate medical device messages in one tab being received in the private chat channel in another tab, then do the following:

- Log in as a user as normal
- `Duplicate` the tab

You can now experience the showcase as the same user in both the original and duplicated tabs.  Be aware that if you log out of one tab, the application will not automatically log you out of the duplicated tab.
